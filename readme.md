# Ball Physics
This is a personal project where I learn how ball physics work. This project
is likely to change shape several times and may occasionally resemble a game.

This is written in JS because it's an easy environment to experiment in.

## Current Features
- Movement and velocity of one ball
- Collision detection against a static layout:
  - Layout is made of vertices
  - Layout is defined as a tilemap
  - Wall ejection
  - Bouncing
